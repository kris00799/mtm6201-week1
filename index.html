    <div class="Intersting Fact About Me">
        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong>I'm someone who sees the world through a storyteller's lens â€” always chasing those real, unfiltered moments that often go unnoticed. Whether it's a quiet sunrise or the beautiful chaos of a crowded street, I believe there's a story waiting to be told in every frame..</p>

    <p>With my camera in hand, I'm drawn to the rhythm of everyday life - the kind of details that speak volumes without saying a word. Photography, for me, isn't just a creative outlet - it's how I connect with the world. It's how I listen, observe, and respond.</p>


    <p>My ultimate dream? To grow into a travel photographer who brings people closer through shared perspectives - showing that no matter where we are, there's a common thread that connects us all. Every journey, near or far, is another chance to discover something new and meaningful - and to share it with others.</p>
